Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using LSTM

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict cryptocurrency prices. Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention in recent years, with their prices exhibiting high volatility. Predicting these prices accurately can be challenging due to various factors influencing the market.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that can forecast the prices of cryptocurrencies based on historical data. By leveraging LSTM, a type of deep learning model capable of learning long-term dependencies, we aim to capture intricate patterns and trends in cryptocurrency price movements.

Key Features:

Data Collection: We gather historical cryptocurrency price data from various sources, including APIs and online databases.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps such as normalization, feature scaling, and sequence generation to prepare it for input into the LSTM model.
Model Development: We employ LSTM networks, known for their ability to capture sequential data patterns, to build our predictive model.
Training: The model is trained on historical cryptocurrency price data, with appropriate validation techniques to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.
Evaluation: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and visualizations to analyze predictions against actual prices.
Prediction: Once trained, the model is capable of making future price predictions for cryptocurrencies, providing insights for investors and traders.
